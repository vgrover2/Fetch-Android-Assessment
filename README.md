# Fetch-Android-Assessment

The Android app is called 'FetchMobileAssess', was done on Android Studio using Java

I've uploaded a zip file of the whole project, and I've also uploaded the Java, xml and build files on the side as a backup

The items from the JSON link are sorted by group (listId) and within each group by name, this is what should display on the app
